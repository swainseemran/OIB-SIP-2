            <p id="quote">Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and
                investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT
                and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of
                the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
                <br>
                Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972
                before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later
                studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I
                personal computer.
                <br>
                Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist,several other jobs,[11] and then
                "back to work as a machinist".
    
                Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957, and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta
                Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in
                order to "pass along his love of mechanics". Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he
                knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a
                hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my
                dad.By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the
                engineers who lived in the neighborhood.He had difficulty making friends with children his
                own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner".
